# Assignment 16: System design of vaaccine registration app

Propose how you would design the vaccine registration system for the entire country considering there will be a few crore users and a lot of vaccine centers distributed in the whole country.

Submit your system design diagram and any additional explanation needed for your design decisions in a PDF file.

Note: The system design diagram doesn't need to be very polished or professional looking. You just need to show the components, how they will interact each other and how you would handle the scaling issues etc.
